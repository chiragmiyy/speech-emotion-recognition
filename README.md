# üé§ Speech Emotion Recognition

A machine learning and deep learning-based system for recognizing emotions from speech using audio features like MFCCs, Spectrograms, and more.

## üìå Overview

This project implements a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) pipeline that uses audio signal processing and classification algorithms to detect emotions from speech. It supports multiple datasets, feature extractors, classifiers, and evaluation metrics.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/chirgamiyy/speech-emotion-recognition.git
cd speech-emotion-recognition

2. Install dependencies
   
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run training or prediction
   
python src/train.py        # Train model
python src/predict.py      # Predict emotion from audio

## üìä Example Results

| Model                 | Dataset              | Accuracy |
|----------------------|----------------------|----------|
| RandomForest          | RAVDESS              | 84.7%    |
| Wav2Vec2 (Fine-tuned) | TESS + EMO-DB        | 88.9%    |
| MLPClassifier         | Custom               | 81.2%    |
| üî• **Best Model**     | Combined Datasets    | **93.96%** ‚úÖ |

- The best model achieves 93.96% accuracy on a balanced, merged dataset of RAVDESS, TESS, CREMA-D, and custom speech recordings.
- All models are evaluated using standard metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- Visualizations and training logs are available in the [`/results/`](./results/) folder.
