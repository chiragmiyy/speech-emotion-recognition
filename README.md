# 🎤 Speech Emotion Recognition

A machine learning and deep learning-based system for recognizing emotions from speech using audio features like MFCCs, Spectrograms, and more.

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) pipeline that uses audio signal processing and classification algorithms to detect emotions from speech. It supports multiple datasets, feature extractors, classifiers, and evaluation metrics.

## 🧠 Supported Emotions

- Neutral
- Calm
- Happy
- Sad
- Angry
- Fearful
- Disgust
- Pleasant Surprise
- Boredom

---

## 🛠️ Features

- 🔉 Extracts audio features (MFCC, Chromagram, Spectrogram, etc.)
- 🤖 Classifiers: SVC, RandomForest, GradientBoosting, KNeighbors, MLP, RNN
- 🧪 Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV
- 📊 Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix
- 💾 Model saving & loading (`.pkl`)
- 🔍 Dataset support: RAVDESS, TESS, EMO-DB, Custom

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/chirgamiyy/speech-emotion-recognition.git
cd speech-emotion-recognition

2. Install dependencies
   
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run training or prediction
   
python src/train.py        # Train model
python src/predict.py      # Predict emotion from audio

## 📊 Example Results

| Model                 | Dataset              | Accuracy |
|----------------------|----------------------|----------|
| RandomForest          | RAVDESS              | 84.7%    |
| Wav2Vec2 (Fine-tuned) | TESS + EMO-DB        | 88.9%    |
| MLPClassifier         | Custom               | 81.2%    |
| 🔥 **Best Model**     | Combined Datasets    | **93.96%** ✅ |

- The best model achieves 93.96% accuracy on a balanced, merged dataset of RAVDESS, TESS, CREMA-D, and custom speech recordings.
- All models are evaluated using standard metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- Visualizations and training logs are available in the [`/results/`](./results/) folder.
